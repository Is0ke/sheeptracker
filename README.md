SheepTracker
====

Sheeptracker is a project made for my 2nd year degree in IT
I retake a base project that already exists and enhance / improve it's functionnalities

All the needed dependencies are in this repo.
This project is built on arduino (last ver.) and uses LoRa network.

The main goal of the project is really simple
----

**Make a device that can help us to understand sheep's behaviour**

In order to that we need to know their location, when they eat, sleep, or being social with other sheeps
