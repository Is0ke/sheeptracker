SheepTracker
====

Sheeptracker is a project made for my 2nd year degree in IT
I retake a base project that already exists and enhance / improve it's functionnalities

All the needed dependencies are in this repo.
This project is built on arduino (last ver.) and uses LoRa network.

The main goal of the project is really simple

Make a device that can help us to understand sheep's behaviour
----

In order to that we need to know: 
* their location
* when they eat
* sleep
* or being social with other sheeps

One driver is hardcoded in the main source code (I know this is bad, but didn't have much time to think about it)
I would be happy if anyone could help me with how to write proper drivers for I2C devices on arduino
